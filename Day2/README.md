This repository contains my completed tasks related to data science fundamentals. Each task explores key concepts, applications, and ethical concerns in data science.  

Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm**  
I have identified five unique applications of data science across various industries and explained their significance.  

Applications Covered:  
- Sports Analytics – Enhancing player performance and game strategies.  
- Personalized Healthcare– Predicting diseases and recommending treatments.  
- Entertainment & Media – Optimizing content recommendations and user engagement.  
- Aerospace Engineering – Predictive maintenance and flight safety improvements.  
- Agriculture – Crop yield prediction and soil health analysis.  

Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram**  
A visual representation showcasing the hierarchical relationship between **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)** has been created.  

Diagram Highlights: 
- AI as the broader concept of intelligent systems.  
- ML as a subset of AI that learns from data.  
- DL as a specialized ML approach using neural networks.  

Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research  
Researched real-world **data science job roles** and outlined three key positions.  

Key Roles:  
1️. Data Analyst – Interprets data, generates reports, and finds business insights.  
2️. Machine Learning Engineer – Builds and optimizes ML models for automation and prediction.  
3️. Data Engineer – Manages data pipelines, ETL processes, and data storage systems.  

Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example
Applied the data science lifecycle to one selected application, detailing each step:  

1. Problem Definition – Identifying the challenge.  
2. Data Collection – Gathering relevant datasets.  
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Preparing data for analysis.  
4. Model Training & Evaluation – Building and assessing models.  
5. Deployment & Monitoring – Implementing the solution and tracking performance.  

Task 5: Data Science Ethics Discussion  
Discussed a critical ethical issue in data science: Bias in Algorithms.
